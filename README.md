# https_client-master-uart
Working with Actinius Icarus nrf9160 board. This code merges the https_client-master and echo_bot_2 projects to have input from uart0 (the console) POSTed to Google Sheets. The https_client-master code connects to Google Sheets (file Telit Test) and sends dummy data. The echo_bot_2 gets uart0 and uart1 talking on the board.
